# RottenBot

RottenBot is an innovative computer vision project aimed at detecting healthy and rotten fruits and vegetables. Using machine learning, it helps users identify spoilage early to reduce food waste.

## Current Status
The project is still under development.

## Features
- Automatic classification of fruits and vegetables as healthy or rotten
- Use of TensorFlow for deep learning models
- Integration with MLflow for experiment tracking
- Support for Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and model training


## Future Use Cases
- **Smart Home Integration:** Integration into smart refrigerators or apps to automatically monitor food conditions and send notifications when spoilage begins.
- **Agricultural Quality Control:** Automated inspection of harvests for sorting and quality assurance on farms.
- **Supermarket Apps:** Mobile applications to help consumers check the freshness of products before purchase.
- **Food Industry Inventory Management:** IoT devices for continuous monitoring of stock and automatic reordering when spoilage risk arises.
- **Educational Projects:** Use in schools or universities to teach computer vision and machine learning.
